- Example files load configuration from config.toml instead of hard-coded values
- Secure credential management for production deployments

## [1.0.15-beta] - 2025-09-27

### Added
- **New Feature**: Configurable ident beacon system for periodic station identification
- Ident beacon broadcasts BBS name, node ID, timestamp, and help hint to public channel
- Configurable frequency options: 15min, 30min, 1hour, 2hours, 4hours (default: 15min)
- Enable/disable control via `[ident_beacon]` section in config.toml
- Smart time-boundary scheduling (beacons fire exactly at configured intervals)
- Fallback node ID handling when dynamic ID unavailable

### Enhanced
- Added comprehensive unit tests for ident beacon configuration and timing logic
- 14 new tests covering frequency validation, serialization, and integration
- Improved configuration validation with clear error messages for invalid frequencies

### Technical
- New `IdentBeaconConfig` struct with serde support for TOML configuration
- Time-based scheduling using chrono for UTC boundary calculations
- Integration with existing public channel broadcast system
- Backward-compatible configuration (defaults to enabled with 15min frequency)

## [1.0.13-beta] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed BBS becoming unresponsive after extended runtime (~1 hour+)
- Reader task could permanently exit on serial I/O errors, causing complete message processing failure
- Implemented resilient error handling: reader continues operating despite transient serial errors
- Added small delays (50-100ms) in error paths to prevent tight error loops
- Enhanced error logging with "continuing operation" messages for transparency

### Technical
- Changed fatal `return Err()` to warning logs in serial read error paths
- Reader task now only exits on shutdown signal or EINTR (controlled shutdown)
- Improved production stability for long-running deployments

## [1.0.12-beta] - 2025-09-26

### Fixed
- **Critical**: `^HELP` messages are now chunked to stay under Meshtastic's 230-byte transmission limit
- Previous help message was 302 bytes, potentially causing transmission failures
- Help content now split into multiple chunks (220-byte safety margin): first chunk with main commands + "DM for BBS access", continuation chunks with "More:" header
- Each chunk sent with 2.5-second delays to respect rate limiting
- Added comprehensive test coverage for message chunking in `tests/help_message_chunking.rs`

### Technical
- Implemented intelligent command distribution across chunks to maximize information density
- Maintains existing scheduler integration and fallback paths
- Verified worst-case scenarios: long BBS names result in 217 + 185 byte chunks (well under limit)

## [1.0.11-beta] - 2025-09-26

### Added
- Enhanced `^HELP` command now broadcasts all available public commands to improve discoverability
- New behavior: `^HELP` sends BBS instructions via DM while broadcasting public commands list to channel
- Comprehensive test coverage for new help behavior in `tests/help_public_commands.rs`

### Changed  
- `^HELP` command now shows: "Public Commands (for {user}): ^HELP - Show this help | ^LOGIN <user> - Register for BBS | ^SLOT - Play slot machine | ^SLOTSTATS - Show your stats | ^8BALL - Magic 8-Ball oracle | ^FORTUNE - Random wisdom | DM for BBS access"
- Updated documentation in README.md and user guides to reflect improved command discoverability
- Enhanced help system description in README from "Compact HELP + verbose HELP+" to "^HELP broadcasts all public commands for discovery, with BBS instructions via DM"

### Fixed
- Resolved critical UX issue where mesh network users had no way to discover available public commands without prior knowledge

## [1.0.10-beta] - 2025-09-26

### Added
- Public command `^FORTUNE` (Fortune Cookies): returns random wisdom from 140 curated Unix fortune database entries including programming quotes, philosophy, literature, and clean humor. All entries under 200 characters for mesh-friendly transmission. Broadcast-only with 5-second per-node cooldown.
- Comprehensive unit test coverage for Fortune module (11 test functions covering database validation, functionality, thread safety, and content quality)
- Helper functions for Fortune module: `fortune_count()` and `max_fortune_length()` for diagnostics and testing
- Extensive rustdoc documentation for Fortune module with examples and thread safety notes
- Development guide for Fortune module at `docs/development/fortune-module.md` with architecture, maintenance, and troubleshooting information

## [1.0.9-beta] - 2025-09-26

### Added
- Public command `^8BALL` (Magic 8‑Ball): returns one of 20 classic responses (emoji‑prefixed). Broadcast‑only with a lightweight per‑node cooldown like `^SLOT`.

### Changed
- Docs: README badge bumped to 1.0.9‑beta; user docs updated to include Magic 8‑Ball.

### Fixed
- Slot machine docs/tests alignment: `^SLOT` clarified as broadcast‑only with a behavior test to prevent regressions.

## [1.0.8-beta] - 2025-09-26

### Changed
- Logging hygiene: demote noisy INFO logs to DEBUG in HELP flow, weather fetch/success, cache loads, serial open, reader/writer init, resend attempts, and per-message delivered ACK logs.

### Fixed
- Public `^SLOT` behavior corrected to be broadcast-only (no DM). `^SLOTSTATS` remains broadcast-first with DM fallback for reliability.

## [1.0.7] - 2025-09-26

Documentation alignment follow-up for the 1.0.6 release.

### Changed
- README and docs tweaks to clarify public broadcast ACK confirmation semantics and command examples. No functional code changes.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-09-26

Broadcast reliability telemetry and optional confirmation for public messages.

### Added
- Optional broadcast ACK request: broadcasts can set `want_ack`; if any node ACKs, we consider it a success ("at least one hop").
- Lightweight broadcast ACK tracking in the writer with a short TTL (no retries) to avoid ACK storms.
- Metrics: `broadcast_ack_confirmed` and `broadcast_ack_expired` counters for trend visibility.

### Changed
- Updated HELP/public broadcast paths to request ACKs for visibility (DMs remain reliable with retries/backoff).
- Documentation updates in `README.md` to describe broadcast confirmation semantics and new metrics.

### Notes
- Direct messages remain fully reliable with ACK tracking, retries, and latency metrics; broadcasts remain best‑effort but can now indicate basic delivery when at least one ACK is observed.

## [1.0.5] - 2025-09-25

Added a public‑channel slot machine mini‑game and related documentation updates.

### Added
- New public commands:
	- `^SLOT` / `^SLOTMACHINE` — spin the slot machine (5 coins per spin; daily refill to 100 when at 0)
	- `^SLOTSTATS` — show your coin balance, total spins, wins, and jackpots
- Persistent per‑player state under `data/slotmachine/players.json` with safe file locking
- Jackpot and stats tracking (total_spins, total_wins, jackpots, last_spin, last_jackpot)
- Runtime packaging skeleton includes `data/slotmachine/.keep`

### Changed
- Updated user documentation (`docs/user-guide/commands.md`) and `README.md` to include new commands and feature blurb
- Bumped crate version to 1.0.5

## [1.0.0 BETA] - 2025-09-25

This is the first public beta for the 1.x series of meshbbs. It stabilizes the core architecture and user experience for Meshtastic devices while inviting broader testing and feedback before the final 1.0.0 release.

What’s in this beta (high level):
- Compact DM‑first UI optimized for Meshtastic frame limits (≤230 bytes), with Topics → Subtopics → Threads → Read navigation, paging, filtering, and breadcrumbs
- Robust help system: single‑frame compact HELP and multi‑chunk verbose HELP+
- Role‑based permissions: users, moderators, and sysop; moderation tools (pin/unpin, rename, lock/unlock, delete with audit log)
- Persistence: JSON‑backed users, topics/subtopics, messages, and replies; state survives restarts
- Meshtastic integration: protobuf support, hop‑limit 3, paced writer with scheduler to minimize airtime contention; optional weather integration
- Security and safety: Argon2id password hashing, command audit logging, UTF‑8 safe clamping/chunking, strict prompt‑aware size enforcement

Known limitations (to be refined before final 1.0):
- Some admin/dashboards are minimal or placeholders
- Performance tuning and CI coverage are ongoing
- Weather relies on an external service and may be rate‑limited

Upgrade and compatibility notes:
- On‑disk data persists in `data/` (topics at `data/topics.json`, messages under `data/messages/`)
- No schema migration is required from recent 0.9 builds; however, regenerating `config.toml` and reviewing new pacing/security options is recommended

Feedback welcome: please report issues and suggestions so we can tighten the final 1.0 release.
