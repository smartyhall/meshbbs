# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through installing and setting up meshbbs on your system.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.82+** - Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Meshtastic Device** - Any compatible device (T-Beam, Heltec, etc.)
- **Connection** - USB cable or Bluetooth capability

## Installation Steps

### Option A: Automated Installation (Linux/Raspberry Pi - Recommended)

For Linux systems and Raspberry Pi, use the provided installation script:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/martinbogo/meshbbs.git
cd meshbbs
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer will:
- Build the release binary
- Create necessary directories
- Guide you through configuration (sysop password, serial port, etc.)
- Set up systemd service for automatic startup
- Install to `/opt/meshbbs`

Skip to [First Run](first-run.md) after installation completes.

### Option B: Manual Installation (All Platforms)

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/martinbogo/meshbbs.git
cd meshbbs
```

> **Note**: The `--recurse-submodules` flag is important for including Meshtastic protobuf definitions.

#### 2. Build the Project

```bash
# Debug build for development
cargo build

# Release build for production
cargo build --release
```

#### 3. Create Configuration

```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

#### 4. Set Sysop Password

```bash
# Interactively set the sysop password
./target/release/meshbbs sysop-passwd
```

This creates a hashed password in your `config.toml` file.

Topics are automatically seeded into `data/topics.json` on first startup. Topics are managed at runtime and not configured in TOML.

#### 5. Configure Your BBS

Edit the generated `config.toml` file:

```toml
[bbs]
name = "Your BBS Name"
sysop = "sysop"
location = "Your Location"
zipcode = "12345"

[meshtastic]
port = "/dev/ttyUSB0"  # Adjust for your system
baud_rate = 115200

[storage]
data_dir = "./data"
max_message_size = 230
```

### 5. Set Sysop Password

```bash
./target/release/meshbbs sysop-passwd
```

### 6. Start Your BBS

```bash
./target/release/meshbbs start
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Linux
- Device typically at `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`
- May need to add user to `dialout` group: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`

### macOS  
- Device typically at `/dev/tty.usbserial-*`
- May need to install serial drivers for some devices

### Windows
- Device typically at `COM3`, `COM4`, etc.
- Check Device Manager for the correct port

## Verification

Once started, you should see output similar to:

```
INFO BBS 'Your BBS Name' started by your_admin_username
INFO Meshtastic device connected on /dev/ttyUSB0
INFO Ready for connections
```

Your BBS is now ready for users to connect via the Meshtastic network!
