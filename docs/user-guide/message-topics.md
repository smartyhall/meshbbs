# Message Topics

Meshbbs organizes discussions into topics and optional subtopics.

- Root topics are shown first; topics with children display a `›` marker
- Selecting a leaf topic opens the Threads view
- Threads list shows pinned messages first and indicates unread activity

## Navigation

- `M` — open Topics (root topics only)
- `1-9` — pick an item on the current page (topics, subtopics, threads)
- `L` — show the next page of results (Topics, Subtopics, or Threads)
- `H` — show contextual help for the current view
- `U` / `B` — go up/back; climbs from Threads → Subtopics → Topics
- `X` — exit the session immediately (same as logging out)
- `WHERE` / `W` — print your breadcrumb (e.g., `Meshbbs > Topics > general > Threads`)

## Reading threads

- `1-9` — open the corresponding thread in the current list
- `+` / `-` — move to the next or previous thread while reading
- `F <text>` — filter thread titles in the Threads view (`F` with no text clears)

## Posting

- `N` — start a new thread from the Threads view
	1. Enter a title (≤32 characters)
	2. Enter the body as a single message (230 bytes max)
- `Y` — reply to the currently open thread while reading; the reply is captured in one message
- Replies and new threads respect topic locks and permissions; locked topics show `[locked]` in the header

## Moderation

Moderators can pin/unpin threads, lock/unlock topics, and delete messages. See the Command Reference for details.
