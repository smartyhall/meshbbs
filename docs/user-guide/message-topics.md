# Message Topics

Meshbbs organizes discussions into topics and optional subtopics.

- Root topics are shown first; topics with children display a `›` marker
- Selecting a leaf topic opens the Threads view
- Threads list shows pinned messages first and indicates unread activity

## Navigation

- `M` — open Topics
- `1-9` — pick an item on the current page
- `L` — show more
- `U` / `B` — go up/back; climbs from Threads → Subtopics → Topics

## Posting

- `POST <topic> <message>` — quick one-line post
- `POST <topic>` — enter multi-line mode, end with a single `.`

## Moderation

Moderators can pin/unpin threads, lock/unlock topics, and delete messages. See the Command Reference for details.
