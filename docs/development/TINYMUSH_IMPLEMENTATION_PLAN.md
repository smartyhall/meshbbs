# TinyMUSH Implementation Plan

_Last updated: 2025-10-08 (Phase 6 Week 1 Complete - commit faa40e4)_

This document converts the design captured in `MUD_MUSH_DESIGN.md` into a disciplined implementation roadmap for the MeshBBS TinyMUSH feature set. It lays out phased milestones, guardrails, and verification steps to keep development focused, measurable, and tightly coupled to the specification.

## Guiding Principles

- **Specification-driven**: Every deliverable must trace back to a section or requirement in `MUD_MUSH_DESIGN.md`.
- **Incremental & testable**: End each phase with running code, automated checks, and documentation updates.
- **Mesh-first**: Honor the 200-byte message constraint, asynchronous delivery, and high-latency mesh behaviors throughout.
- **Audit-ready**: Maintain changelogs, structured commits, and validation logs for each phase.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Focus | Primary Deliverables | Acceptance Gates |
|-------|-------|----------------------|------------------|
| 0 | Environment & discipline setup | Tooling checklist, contribution workflow updates | Branch created, plan approved |
| 1 | Core data models & persistence | Rust structs, Sled integration, serialization tests | Unit tests passing, schema migration docs |
| 2 | Command parser & session plumbing | Command dispatcher, routing, session state | Parser tests, latency simulation harness |
| 3 | Room navigation & world state foundation | Room graph engine, movement commands, persistence | Movement integration tests, 200-byte validation |
| 4 | Social & communication systems | Chat, emotes, mail, bulletin boards | Functional tests, moderation hooks |
| 5 | Economy, inventory, and shops | Currency handling, inventory CRUD, vendor logic | Transaction rollback tests, anti-dupe checks |
| 6 | Quest, tutorial, and progression | Tutorial flow, quest actors, achievements | Narrative scripts tested, telemetry dashboards |
| 7 | Housing, MUSH building, triggers | Room creation, permissions, builder tooling | Security review, abuse prevention tests |
| 8 | Admin/GM tooling & observability | Admin consoles, logging, backups | Admin workflows verified, recovery drill |
| 9 | Performance, polish, and go-live prep | Load tests, docs, launch checklist | Performance SLAs, release sign-off |

## Phase 0 – Project Discipline (Week 0)

**Objectives**
- Confirm `tinymush` branch strategy, commit message conventions, and review process.
- Establish a running checklist for 200-byte compliance validation (reuse scripts from prior work).
- Document testing matrix: unit, integration (`cargo test --tests`), scenario replay, and byte-check automation.

**Tasks**
1. Lock in branch naming (`feature/tinymush-*`), commit format (`tinymush: scope - summary`).
2. Configure `just` or shell scripts for:
   - Running full test suites with profiling.
   - Executing UTF-8 byte-length validation for sample payloads.
3. Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with TinyMUSH-specific development expectations.
4. Inventory existing changes (e.g., `Cargo.lock`, `MUD_MUSH_DESIGN.md`) and ensure rebasing plan.
5. Specify the **enumerated G)ames submenu** contract:
   - Render games as numbered entries (e.g., `1) TinyHack`, `2) TinyMUSH`).
   - Accept `G` + number (and optional slug aliases) for selection.
   - Document fallback behavior when games are toggled off/on or when additional titles appear.
   - Update design notes so TinyMUSH leverages the shared numbering system from day one.

**Exit Criteria**
- Branch `tinymush` pushed (or ready) with baseline scaffolding.
- Engineering discipline artifacts stored in `docs/development`.

## Phase 1 – Core Data Models & Persistence (Weeks 1-2) ✅ COMPLETE

**Spec References**: Sections _Technical Implementation_, _Embedded Database Options_, _Player State_.

**Status**: ✅ Complete (commit d91483e)

**Objectives**
- Implement foundational data structures (`PlayerState`, `RoomState`, `SessionState`, `InventoryItem`).
- Integrate Sled-backed persistence with serialization (prefer `bincode` or `serde_cbor`).
- Establish migration story for existing MeshBBS users.

**Tasks**
1. Define Rust modules under `src/mud/` (e.g., `state`, `storage`, `types`).
2. Implement Sled tree namespaces (`players`, `rooms`, `mail`, `logs`).
3. Create persistence API with transactional helpers (`save_player`, `load_room_graph`).
4. Write unit tests mocking Sled with temp directories (`tempfile`).
5. Generate docs (`cargo doc`) to confirm public API completeness.

**Exit Criteria**
- `cargo test` (unit-level) passes locally and in CI.
- Example scripts demonstrate save/load round-trips with schema checksum.
- Data structures documented in `docs/development` addendum (link back to design).

- Wire inventory slots, item metadata, and transaction engine
- Build vendor interactions (Bakery, General Store, Blacksmith, etc.)
- Add transaction logging, rollback capability, and anti-duplication safeguards

**Currency System Design** (new requirement)

The economy must support **two distinct currency systems** to accommodate different world themes:

1. **Decimal Currency** (modern/sci-fi): Single currency with configurable name, symbol, and decimal places
   - Examples: Credits ($), MiniBucks (¤), Euros (€)
   - Storage: Integer minor units (like cents) to avoid floating-point issues
   - Display: Configurable decimal places (typically 2)

2. **Multi-Tier Currency** (fantasy/medieval): Multiple denominations with conversion ratios
   - Examples: Platinum/Gold/Silver/Copper with configurable names
   - Storage: Base copper units with configurable tier ratios
   - Display: Multiple denominations (e.g., "15gp 25sp 30cp")

**World builders choose ONE system per world via configuration.**

   - tier names/symbols, conversion ratios (configurable, default: 1pp=1M cp, 1gp=10k cp, 1sp=100cp)
4. ✅ Create `CurrencyAmount` enum with unified base_value() accessor
5. ✅ Add currency config section to world settings (TOML)

**Storage & Conversion (Week 6, Days 3-4): ✅ COMPLETE**
6. ✅ Implement storage strategy:
   - Decimal: Store as integer minor units (cents)
   - Multi-tier: Store as base copper units
   - Both use i64 for range and signed math
7. ✅ Build conversion functions between systems:
   - Standard ratio: 100 copper = 1 major decimal unit

    - Decimal: Symbol + formatted number (e.g., "$10.50")
    - Multi-tier: Abbreviated tiers (e.g., "15gp 25sp 30cp")
16. ✅ Input parsing for player currency commands:
    - Decimal: Accept "10.50", "10", decimals optional

22. ✅ Prevent item duplication exploits (transaction-based item transfers)

**Shop & Vendor System (Week 8, Days 3-5): ✅ COMPLETE**
23. ✅ Shop configuration with inventory, pricing, and buy/sell ratios
24. ✅ Dynamic pricing with stock levels and reputation discounts
25. ⏳ Vendor NPC integration with dialog and purchase flow (future Phase 6)
