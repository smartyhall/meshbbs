## 🌟 Overview

Meshbbs revolutionizes communication on mesh networks by bringing the beloved Bulletin Board System experience to Meshtastic devices. Exchange messages, participate in forums, and build communities over long-range, low-power radio networks, all without traditional internet infrastructure.

Perfect for emergency communications, remote areas, outdoor adventures, and building resilient community networks.

## 📝 Release Notes

**Version 1.1.2** adds configurable help command keywords to address emergency assistance protocol concerns on some mesh networks.

**Version 1.1.1** completes the data-driven admin system expansion with comprehensive player and object management commands. This release adds critical missing features that enable runtime editing of all game content without code modification.

**Admin System Enhancements:** Three powerful new admin commands (@GIVE, @TELEPORT, @STATS) provide complete player management capabilities. Room and object editing expanded with ownership transfers, visibility controls (including new Hidden visibility mode for secret rooms), housing tag configuration, exit removal, and lock management. All 10 identified gaps in the data-driven system have been implemented.

**Previous Major Release (v1.1.0):** Complete transformation from basic BBS into fully data-driven, production-ready platform with TinyMUSH game engine, systemd/daemon integration, automated welcome system, message replication infrastructure, and comprehensive content management through six admin command interfaces. See full v1.1.0 changelog below for details.

---

**Version 1.1.0** represents a major milestone of development of meshbbs for me... completing the transformation from a basic bulletin board system into a fully data-driven, production-ready platform. This release encompasses both significant **core BBS infrastructure improvements** and a complete **TinyMUSH game engine** with comprehensive content management capabilities. It also measn that I've completely ported the BBS for the third time. In the 90's it was written in Pascal, then I ported it to Java, and now in its third iteration it has been fully ported to Rust!

**Core BBS Platform:** The infrastructure matured significantly with production-ready daemon mode featuring cross-platform graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGHUP/SIGINT on Unix, Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break on Windows), TTY-aware logging that eliminates duplicate output, and systemd/launchd integration. The automated welcome system greets new mesh nodes with personalized name suggestions (2,500+ combinations of adjectives, animals, and emojis) using a reliable TEXT_MESSAGE_APP ping system with routing ACK verification. Message replication infrastructure was added with unique 6-byte message IDs and CRC-16 integrity checksums, laying the groundwork for future inter-BBS synchronization. Additional improvements include optimized welcome queue processing (10× faster, completing 17-node startup in ~8.5 minutes instead of ~85 minutes), UTF-8 safe message chunking that prevents crashes with multi-byte characters, configurable ident beacons for station identification (5min to 4hour intervals), installation script enhancements with proper password hashing and path layout (`/opt/meshbbs/bin/` and `/opt/meshbbs/scripts/`), and comprehensive configuration validation preventing silent failures.

**TinyMUSH Game Engine:** The centerpiece of 1.1.0 is the complete MUD/MUSH engine with **data-driven content management**, featuring six comprehensive admin command interfaces (@ACHIEVEMENT, @NPC, @COMPANION, @ROOM, @OBJECT, @QUEST/@RECIPE) that enable runtime modification of all game content without recompilation. All seed content now loads from editable JSON files in `data/seeds/` (npcs.json, companions.json, rooms.json, achievements.json, quests.json, recipes.json), supporting modding, version control, and easy customization while maintaining backwards compatibility through hardcoded fallbacks. The game features 20+ interactive rooms, 5 NPCs with dialogue trees, personal per-player landing rooms that prevent collision in shared spaces, tutorial flow improvements requiring explicit NPC interaction, expanded quest content with Phase 4 epic quests (The Cipher, Into the Depths, Master Artisan, The Lost Artifact) offering 87,000+ currency and 1,950 XP rewards, Phase 5 reputation system with 6 factions and 7 levels, advanced trigger system (14 action types with conditional logic), complete economy with currency/shops/trading, companion system with tameable creatures, crafting recipes, and achievement tracking across 6 categories.

- Install to `/opt/meshbbs`

**Option 2: Manual Installation (All Platforms)**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/martinbogo/meshbbs.git
cd meshbbs

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Copy example configuration
cp config.example.toml config.toml

# Edit configuration (see below)
nano config.toml
```
### ⚙️ Configure Your BBS

**Automated Installation (Linux/Raspberry Pi):**
The `install.sh` script handles most configuration automatically during installation:
- ✅ Sysop password (prompted during install, securely hashed)
- ✅ Serial port selection (interactive menu)
- ✅ Basic BBS settings with sensible defaults
- ✅ Data directories and permissions
- ✅ Systemd service configuration

**Post-Installation Customization:**
After running the installer, you should customize these settings in `/opt/meshbbs/config.toml`:

1. **🎯 BBS Identity** - Personalize your BBS:
   ```toml
   [bbs]
   name = "Your BBS Name"         # Change from default
   location = "Your Location"     # Update location
   description = "Your BBS info"  # Add description
   welcome_message = "Welcome!"   # Customize welcome
   ```

2. **🌤️ Weather Setup** - Enable weather features (optional):
   ```toml
   [weather]
   api_key = "your_api_key_here"  # Get free at openweathermap.org
   enabled = true                 # Set to true after adding API key
   default_location = "Portland"  # Your default city
   location_type = "city"         # "city", "zipcode", or "city_id"
   country_code = "US"           # Optional country code
   ```

3. **📡 Fine-tune Meshtastic** - Adjust timing if needed:
   ```toml
   [meshtastic]
   port = "/dev/ttyUSB0"          # Already set by installer
   min_send_gap_ms = 2000         # Minimum gap between sends
   dm_resend_backoff_seconds = [4, 8, 16]  # DM retry timing
   ```

**Manual Installation (All Platforms):**
If you didn't use the installer, configure these critical settings:

```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp config.example.toml config.toml
nano config.toml
```

1. **📡 Serial Port** - Set your Meshtastic device port:
   ```toml
   [meshtastic]
   port = "/dev/ttyUSB0"    # Linux: /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0
                            # macOS: /dev/tty.usbserial-*
                            # Windows: COM3, COM4, etc.
   ```

2. **🔐 Sysop Password** - Set your admin password:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/meshbbs sysop-passwd
   ```
   This will prompt for a password and update the `sysop_password_hash` field in config.toml.

### 🚀 Start Your BBS

**Automated Installation (systemd):**
```bash
# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable --now meshbbs

# Check status and view logs
sudo systemctl status meshbbs
sudo journalctl -u meshbbs -f
```

**Manual Installation:**
```bash
# Start the BBS server
./target/release/meshbbs start

# Or run in daemon mode (background)
./target/release/meshbbs start --daemon
```

> For complete command reference, see the [Command Line Interface](#command-line-interface) section below.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Meshbbs uses a `config.toml` file for all settings.

**Configuration File Locations:**
- **Installed via install.sh:** `/opt/meshbbs/config.toml`
- **Manual installation:** `./config.toml` (in project directory)

**Setup Methods:**
- **Automated:** Use `install.sh` (Linux/Raspberry Pi) - creates config with interactive prompts
- **Manual:** Copy `config.example.toml` to `config.toml` and edit as needed

Topics are managed in `data/topics.json` (runtime store) and are seeded automatically on first startup. Manage topics interactively from within the BBS; existing installations with `[message_topics.*]` in TOML remain supported for backward compatibility (they'll be merged into the runtime store at startup).

```

> **Note for installed systems:** Use full paths like `/opt/meshbbs/bin/meshbbs` when the service is running, and stop the service first before running diagnostic commands.

### 📡 Connecting via Meshtastic

Meshbbs uses a **two-step interaction model** that keeps the shared mesh channel quiet while enabling rich private sessions.

#### 🔍 **Step 1: Say Hello on the Public Channel**
Commands require a prefix to address the BBS. The default is `^`, but your sysop can set a different one in `bbs.public_command_prefix`:
- `<prefix>HELP` - Shows all public commands and BBS login info (default `^HELP`)
- `<prefix>LOGIN <username>` - Registers pending login for your node ID (default `^LOGIN`)
- `<prefix>WEATHER` - Get current weather information (default `^WEATHER`)
 - `<prefix>SLOT` / `<prefix>SLOTMACHINE` - Spin the emoji slot machine (costs 5 coins; daily refill to 100 when at 0) (default `^SLOT`)
 - `<prefix>SLOTSTATS` - Show your slot coin balance, wins, and jackpots (default `^SLOTSTATS`)
- `<prefix>8BALL <question>` - Magic 8-Ball oracle for life's mysteries (default `^8BALL`)
- `<prefix>FORTUNE` - Receive random wisdom and inspiration (default `^FORTUNE`)

#### 💬 **Step 2: Start Your Private Conversation**
After public `LOGIN`, open a private message to the BBS node to start your authenticated session.

#### 🎛️ Compact Message UI (DM Session)

Once logged in via DM, use the compact, single-letter flow:

- Topics (press M)
   - Digits 1‑9: select topic on the current page (root topics only)
   - Topics with children show a ‘›’ marker; selecting opens Subtopics
   - L: more topics, H: help, B: back, X: exit
   
  Subtopics
   - Digits 1‑9: select subtopic; nested levels supported
   - U/B: up one level; M: back to root Topics; L: more
- Threads (inside a topic)
   - Digits 1‑9: read thread
   - N: new thread (2 steps: title ≤32, then body ≤200)
   - F <text>: filter thread titles (repeat F to clear)
   - L: more, B: back (to Subtopics or Topics), M: topics, H: help
- Read view
   - +: next, -: prev, Y: reply, B: back, H: help
   - Shows the latest reply preview (prefixed with "- ")

Shortcuts:
- HELP / HELP+: compact vs. verbose help
- WHERE / W: show breadcrumb path, e.g. `[BBS] You are at: Meshbbs > Topics > hello > Threads`

Indicators:
- Topics list shows per-topic new message counts since your last login, e.g. `1. general (2)`
- Threads list shows a `*` on titles with new content since your last login

</details>

### 🎯 Dynamic Prompts

Meshbbs shows contextual prompts that reflect your current state:

| Prompt | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `unauth>` | Not logged in |
| `alice (lvl1)>` | Logged in as alice, user level 1 |
| `alice@general>` | Reading messages in 'general' topic |
| `post@general>` | Posting a message to 'general' topic |

### 📏 Message Size Limit

Each outbound message (body + optional newline + dynamic prompt) is limited to **230 bytes** (not characters) to match Meshtastic constraints. Multi‑byte UTF‑8 characters reduce visible character count. The server applies a UTF‑8 safe clamp at send‑time and then appends the prompt, ensuring frames always fit.

Reply storage is structured and backward compatible: new replies record `timestamp`, `author`, and `content`, while legacy plain-string replies continue to display correctly.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Meshbbs is built with a clean, modular architecture in Rust:

### 📁 Module Structure

- **`bbs/`**: Core BBS functionality and user interface
- **`meshtastic/`**: Meshtastic device communication layer
  - Parses protobuf frames and emits structured `TextEvent` items
- **`storage/`**: Message and file storage subsystem  
- **`config/`**: Configuration management

## 🛠️ Development

### 🔧 Building from Source

```bash
# Development build
cargo build

# Optimized release build
cargo build --release

# Run comprehensive test suite
cargo test

# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- start
```

### 🎛️ Feature Flags

Control optional functionality with Cargo features:

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `serial` | ✅ | Serial port communication |
| `meshtastic-proto` | ✅ | Protobuf parsing of Meshtastic packets |
| `weather` | ✅ | Real-time weather via OpenWeatherMap API |
| `api-reexports` | ✅ | Re-export internal types |

```bash
# Minimal build without optional features
cargo build --no-default-features

# Build with specific features only
cargo build --features "serial,weather"
```

### 📡 Meshtastic Protobuf Integration

For rich packet handling, enable the `meshtastic-proto` feature. Upstream protobuf definitions are included as a git submodule.

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Protobuf Setup Instructions</strong></summary>

**Fresh clone with submodules:**
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/martinbogo/meshbbs.git
```

**Initialize submodules in existing clone:**
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Build with protobuf support:**
```bash
cargo build --features meshtastic-proto
```

**Update submodules:**
```bash
git submodule update --remote third_party/meshtastic-protobufs
git add third_party/meshtastic-protobufs
git commit -m "chore(deps): bump meshtastic protobufs"
```

**Use custom proto directory:**
```bash
MESHTASTIC_PROTO_DIR=path/to/protos cargo build --features meshtastic-proto
```
