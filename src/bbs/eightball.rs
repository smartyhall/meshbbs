//! Magic 8-Ball mini-feature used by public channel command &lt;prefix&gt;8BALL (default prefix `^`).
//!
//! Behavior:
//! - Stateless: no persistence; just returns a random classic response
//! - Delivery: public broadcast only (best-effort), same reliability posture as `<prefix>SLOT`
//! - Rate limit: handled by PublicState.allow_8ball (light per-node cooldown like `<prefix>SLOT`)
